- Step 1: login via Facebook, Twitter, Google and Linkedin
  + I see, so the first time you login using facebook, you want user to create user name ( his email for facebook, ex ) and password for every next login, right? 
  + and we just get user infor from facebook first time login
  + so, if user has many social accounts with just 1 email, there should be only 1 user on our system
